# My Neovim Config!

Based on kickstart and kickstart-modular, so thanks to those folks.

I have two main branches---this one and my copilot branch. This is because sometimes I like copilot
and sometimes I think nobody should ever use it. As such, they are kept exactly the same except for the
presence or absence of copilot.
